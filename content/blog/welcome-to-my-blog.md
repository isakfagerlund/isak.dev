# how i changed my mind on coding with ai

i used to think ai coding tools were just hype. but then i realized the real distinction is between **vibe engineering** and **vibe coding**. vibe engineering means you understand the architecture and the system you're building. you use ai for the boring parts like boilerplate and repetitive code. vibe coding means asking ai to build things you don't understand. that leads to technical debt you can't fix.

**don't delegate your thinking to ai**. your thinking is what makes you valuable. delegate the grunt work instead. ai is great at writing boilerplate, converting designs to code, and handling repetitive patterns. but your ability to break down problems and make decisions is irreplaceable. don't let yourself become useless. Think more like a leader.
